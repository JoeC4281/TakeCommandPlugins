Manipulate clocks 1 - 8

&nbsp;

CLOCK&nbsp; N \[ON \| OFF \| ZERO \| ZON \| ZOFF\]

&nbsp;

&nbsp; Returns 1 if clock N is running, 0 if not.

&nbsp;

&nbsp; When 4UTILS.DLL is loaded, clocks 1 to 4 are zero and stopped.

&nbsp;

&nbsp; Clock 0 (a pseudo-clock) gives the duration of the 4NT/TCMD session.

&nbsp; It can be read with @CLOCK; it cannot be manipulated with CLOCK.
